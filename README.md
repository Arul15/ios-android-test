**Android/iOS Exercise** 

This is a basic test for iOS and Android candidates. This test should not take you more than 1 hour to complete. Simply follow these instructions:

 1. Fork this repository
 2. Create a new iOS or Android Project with just one screen
 3. Use the API mentioned below to get a list of football/soccer games for one season
 4. Show the details(home team, away team, status, goals, date/time) of all the games in a list
 5. Extra credit: Store the data locally on the device. When the app loads for the second time, use the local data if it has been loaded already.
 6. Send the link to your Github repository once all the code has been pushed

Things to remember:

 1. Use best practices. Code quality matters.
 2. There is a limit on the API but it should be sufficient. You can request for an API key but it is not required.
 3. A clean UI helps but you don't have to spend too much time on perfecting it.
 4. Use libraries to make things easier (Hint: RestKit/Retrofit)
 5. Spend as little time as possible.
